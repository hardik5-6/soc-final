# CNN-lytical
The SOC was a great opportunity to introduce myself to AI/ML, if only to have myself recoil with a sneer not unlike one I had for chemistry.
What I learnt:
- The core mathematics behind machine learning models.
- How to use a jupyter notebook in vscode.
- How to setup an ML workspace in pytorch and go about testing a model.
- Some new numpy functions
